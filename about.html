        <p>Stressed about the college process? Don't know where to start? No need to worry! You've come to right place.
          That Was Easy offers an interactive timeline that maps out the steps you need to take in order to apply for college.
          We're not people who applied to college 20 years ago. We are a team of students who just graduated from high school, and who know the steps
          of the college process.</p>

      <h3> Thema Williams </h3>
      <p> Hi everyone! My name is Thema and I am from Brooklyn, NY. I intend on majoring in electrical engineering at Boston University.
        Hopefully, I can combine my tolerance for computer science with my passion of making the world more reliant on renewable energy.
        I have enjoyed my time at CSSI. In addition, I am so honored to have received this opportunity to be a part of such an amazing group.
        For our final project, we made a website so thanks for visiting. We worked really hard on it and hope you enjoy!
         We just wanted to show you that the college process may be challenging but it is definately possible to do well. Good luck!</p>

      <p id= "ana" >My name is Ana Yanes Martinez. I was born in El Salvador, but immigrated to the United States in 2006, and have lived in Roosevelt,
        New York since then. I will be attending Carleton College in the fall, and I plan to major in Computer Science. I am

      <h3> Nicolas Fernandez </h3>
      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Nicolas Fernandez. I'm originally from NYC, Inwood (neighborhood above Washington Heights), in particular.
        I will be attending Wesleyan University in the fall and am still deciding on what major to choose from: most likely either CS,
        Environmental Studies, Political Science or some combination of the three. I love sports (let's go Steph Curry!),
        music (from Pachabel's Canon in D to Tupac's Only God Can Judge Me), dancing (Hip Hop, Bachata, Salsa) and have many other interests.</p>
