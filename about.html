        <p>Stressed about the college process? Don't know where to start? No need to worry! You've come to right place.
          That Was Easy offers an interactive timeline that maps out the steps you need to take in order to apply for college.
          We're not people who applied to college 20 years ago. We are a team of students who just graduated from high school, and who know the steps
          of the college process.</p>
