      <p> Drum Roll. It is that time of the year when you will spend most of your time refreshing your emails, and checking the mail for any signs
        of those greatly desired college acceptances. Not so fast, though! You have to make sure that the schools you applied to have received all the
        documents needed. Make sure you have applied for financial aid, and are constantly applying to scholarships. Some schools will require you
        to have a college interview, so make sure you are checking your emails for any sign of an alumni, or reaching out to admissions for
        an interview. Just because it is the end of your high school years,it doesn't mean that you should let your grades drop. Colleges care, if they see that for an unknown reason, your grades dropped, you may get your acceptance rescinded. Avoid senioritis.
        This is a good time for you to begin writing thank you letters to the teachers and everyone else who has helped you with  your college applications.   <p>
