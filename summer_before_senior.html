            <p id= 'tips'> This is the beginning of the end.  Common App will open in August 1st, as will many other college applications and scholarships. This is the time
              for you to start finalizing your college list, to visit colleges, and review for the SAT/ACT if you still have not taken them.
              Organization is key! It is important that during the summer you begin creating some productive habits that will last with you for the rest of
              the college application season. YOU DO NOT WANT TO FALL INTO THE CYCLE OF PROCRASTINATION. During this time you should: <p>
            <p id= 'tips'> Create a tentative college list. Visit colleges. Apply to college fly-in programs (aka a free trip 3-day or so vacation to visit a college)
            Research scholarship programs, and make a list of those you want to apply. Start drafting college essays. Work a summer job (you've got to pay those
            college application fees remember). Study for the SAT/ACT/SAT Subject Tests. Volunteer. Create a resume if you still have not. Create a Common App account,
            or other college application account and begin applying. But remember to enjoy your summer as well! <p>
