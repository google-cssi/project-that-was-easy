            <p id= 'tips'>  You've done all this work to get to this point. Don't stop now make sure that everything needed for school is done. You may have an internship or something similar lined up for the summer but one thing you should keep in mind is that the hard work is done.
               However, don’t forget some things like calling your school to make sure that everything is okay.
                Everything includes financial aid, scholarships, class schedule, etc. Don’t be afraid to call your school and
                ask for answers! You have made it this far so you have done something right (maybe following our tips listed here!).
                 Good luck in college and don’t forget to celebrate your achievements.  <p>
